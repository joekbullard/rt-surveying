                <p>
                <i>“A pragmatic, proportionate and reasonable approach to tree safety”</i>
                </br>
                </br>
                The chance of being killed by a tree is 1:10,000,000 and therefore the law does not expect 
                land owners to maintain their trees to a ‘completely safe’ condition. The shear nature of 
                a tree does not allow them to ever be completely safe. However, if you are a land owner or 
                responsible for the management of trees, you are required to manage risk within reasonable levels. 
                </br>

                Rockell Tree Surveying offer professional tree inspections of individual trees in private 
                dwellings to extensive populations across a number of landscapes. Our survey reports include 
                accurate data which is displayed spatially using GIS mapping software. Relevant information 
                on the trees physiological and structural condition and the identification and management of 
                significant pest and diseases is provided and capped off with any remedial/management recommendations, 
                outlined with safe timescales and with highlight levels of work priorities.
                </br>
                </br>
                Trees are an important aspect of our environment and at Rockell Tree Surveying we understand 
                the importance of a trees ecological, cultural and historic value. We will ensure any legal 
                requirements, such as Tree Preservation Order (TPO), felling licensing and locality within a 
                conservation area, are identified and integrated into the specification and adhered to following 
                the necessary channels. 
                </br>
                </br>
                To ensure that management for large tree populations is both practical and proportionate, 
                we will normally carry out a preliminary site visit to help distinguish the client’s requirements 
                and assess how the land is used around the trees. The frequency and type of inspection can be 
                customised to ensure that resources are distributed to the trees which require it the most. 
                Working to a bespoke risk management plan is a cost effective and defendable approach to tree safety. 
                This ensures peace of mind with regards to the condition of your trees and demonstrates that you 
                are fulfilling your duty of care.

                <h3><u>Aerial Tree Inspections - Bats</u></h3>
                </br>
                A number of species of bat fully rely on trees for roost sites, compared to others who use them 
                for limited parts of the year. The UK is home to seventeen bat species, thirteen of which are known 
                to roost in trees. Any tree has the potential to house bats and identifying them solely from the 
                ground is not an easy task.
                </br>
                </br>
                Undertaking a single aerial survey can provide presence/absence. This may remove the need to undertake 
                a number of dusk/dawn surveys, which can involve costly survey effort and be limited within a window 
                between April-October to accommodate bat activity months. Aerial tree surveys are recognised by the 
                Bat Conservation Trust as a technique to assess bat roost suitability. The methodology is also considered 
                to provide greater rates of success than traditional survey techniques.
                </br>
                </br>
                Rockell Tree Surveying has ample experience climbing and inspecting trees for bats across a number of 
                different settings. We have staff who climb at a high level of standard ensuring health and safety is
                paramount and that any potential feature is fully inspected using endoscopes.
